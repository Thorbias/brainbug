# Portable Mouse - Razer Pro Click Mini vs. HP 420
TLDR; Razer Pro Click Mini is sexy and small - but just too small to fit comfortably in my hands. I preferre the not so fancy HP 420 as it comes with all features I need (side click wheel and two thumb buttons) and although it's compact it fits very well in my hands.
