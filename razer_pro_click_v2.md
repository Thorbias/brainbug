# Thoughts about the Razer Pro Click v2 in comparison to the Razer Pro Click v1

## Intro
As my beloved Razer Pro Click - the original version - slowly wears out and seems to reach the end of it's life. This is kind of a tragedy for me as this is by far the best mouse I have ever used - and Razer stopped producing it.
The size, weight and sculpture of the mouse is just perfect for me. It has all the buttons I need at the right place, it works with cable, Bluetooth and 2.4Ghz dongle. The mouse wheel feels just right and has left/right clickability.
But the best thing about this mouse is that all buttons are programmable and stored on the mouse itself. This gives me the freedom to use this mouse in every environment I like wihtout the need of other software or hoping Razer will finally support macOS and Linux.
But enough about the Razer Pro Click v1...

## Razer Pro Click v2
It is black. That is a question of taste, but I very much liked the clean white look of the older version. And it now comes with RGB colors... I am no kiddie, I don't need colors on my mouse. But on the other hand. A dimmed purple glow below the mouse looks really nice :)
The mouse feels just like v1 and that is a very very good thing. It feels and weights right. But the clicks changed. Now the feel and sound of the click is harder, and louder. Also a matter of taste but the old silent smooth clicks where more of my likings.
A button is missing! Instead of having a free programmable button behind the mouse wheel, there is now a toggle switch that changes the wheels operation mode from rasterized to free spinning. Nice feature but the button was way more useful and I don't really nedd a fidget spinner built into my mouse...
The new USB-C charging port is in comparison to the old Micro-USB charging cable a real upgrade.

### The real no-go
The new Razer Pro Click v2 is only compatible with synapse 4 and the programmable buttons don't work anymore as they used to. With synapse 3 I could easily map any button to a F-Key of my keyboard.
This gives me the freedom of assigning F16 and F17 to the left/right of the mouse wheel which I than map to switching the virtual desktops in macOS.
But this key feature no longer works! Not sure if it is due to Synapse 4 being buggy (I read some reports about that) or due to some firmware issues on the mouse itself. Anyhow, if I remap the buttons they won't work on macOS.
Even worse, the stupid AI assistant feature for a wheel long press could not be turned off. No matter to what function I remapped this macro the AI assistant kept popping up and annoyed me.

## Bottom line
The only two pro's of the new mouse is that it has the same sculpture as the old one and that it now features USB-C.
Everything else got worse and with the stupid AI assistant that can not be turned off and the not working button mapping Razer just ruined the best mouse I have ever had - R.I.P. Razer Pro Click, you have been an awsome piece of hardware.
