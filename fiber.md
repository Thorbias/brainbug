# Switching my Internet Service Provider - from Telekom to 1&1
Two years ago Telkom installed FTTH in our house and offered a two year contract for 100MBit/s internet at roughly 45€ per month. I took the offer and as the end of my two year contract came closer I started to receive calls from the sales guys. And the more calls I received the more aggressive their sales methods became until they reached a point where they told me total b/S and lied to me. And although I told them I planned to stick with Telekom but I don't want an upgrade but keep paying my 45€ they tried to push me into more expensive contracts. Finally I was so pissed that I turned away from Telekom and took a very appealing offer at 1&1. 

Technically the switch was super simple. Actually I was a bit nervous if I what strand inbetween Telekom and 1&1 without a reliable internet for several days. But to my suprise the switch was almost seamless with only one click that I had to do - ok maybe a bit more but really really simple.
I could reuse my Telekom Glasfaser Modem 2 without any changes to the configuration. On the day of the ISP switch I had to insert my Modem ID in a 1&1 webpage. And in my Fritzbox 7530AX I only had to change one single parameter: the internet provider from Telekom to 1&1. That's it!
